          Our Sauvignon Blanc wine was entered for the first time in a
          competition and immediately received this award. Experts noted the
          amazing aroma and luxurious taste of our wine. This award has become
          an important impetus for the development of our company.

          In 1992, in conditions of very tough competition from winemakers in
          our state, our wine managed to take first place. It was preferred by
          most critics of Orange Wine Fund. They noted the bright and rich taste
          of our Pinot Noir, its ruby color, and intense aroma.

          Our Chardonnay got a gold medal at the Wine Corporation Annual
          Contest. Our wine scored the highest number of points – 99 out of 100
          possible, and was rated by experts and critics as “amazing”. By the
          way, a few bottles of Chardonnay produced in 2016 are still on sale.
